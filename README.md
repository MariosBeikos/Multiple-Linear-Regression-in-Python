# Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-Python
Multiple Linear Regression (uses OLS) programmed in Python from scratch using only the library "numpy". Results are exported in a .txt as well as a .html file. 
Although i cant upload the data used, i have uploaded the reports/exports.
The imported data for the regressionmust follow certain rules:
  1st row is the names of the columns
  1st columns is id
  columns must be seperated with the "\t" character (known as tab; same one microsoft excel uses)
  data must end with an empty line
  Quick .txt example:
"
Id  Avariable  BVar  CVar
1  123  342  10
2  123  234  3.6
3  0.03  432  5.43
4  567  654  3.4
